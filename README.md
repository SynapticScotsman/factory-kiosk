Interactive Smart Factory Kiosk
===============================

This demo displays a factory artboard with configurable hotspots.

- **Edit Hotspots** via `editor.html`, which saves settings to `localStorage` and downloads a `config.json`.
- The viewer page (`index.html`) loads the saved configuration from `localStorage` first and falls back to `config.json` if missing.
- Hotspots can be positioned horizontally and vertically, and support multiple fonts for their labels.
